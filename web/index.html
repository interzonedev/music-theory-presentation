                    <p class="fragment">
                        Sound is the movement of pressure changes in a material like air, water or metal.

                    <h2>What is Pressure?</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Air is made up of molecules of oxygen and nitrogen that fly around and bump into any surfaces
                        they encounter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Pressure is how hard these molecules press against a surface.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        We feel the pressure of the air around us on our bodies.  It feels normal but if we go to higher
                        altitude, we can feel the pressure decrease in our ears.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        When air is "squeezed" into a smaller volume, the pressure gets higher.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        When air molecules are pushed closer together, it is call <em>compression</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        When they are spread apart, it is called <em>rarefaction</em>.

                    <h2>Vibration</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Repetitive back and forth movement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Can be a pendulum, a tuning fork, a spring, a guitar string, a piano string etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Each vibration is also known as a cycle or an oscillation.

                    <h2>Vibrations Can Travel</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        When an object vibrates, it causes similar vibrations in the pressure of the surrounding air.
                        These vibrations travel away from the object and can be detected by the human ear and processed
                        by the brain as sound.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        This is called a sound wave.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Sound waves can travel through a gas (air), a liquid (water) or a solid (metal or rock).

                    <p class="fragment">
                        How fast a sound wave moves is called the <em>velocity</em> (meters per second).
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        The distance between the high pressure areas of a sound wave is called the <em>wavelength</em>
                        (meters).
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        The number of high pressure areas detected by the ear per second is called the
                        <em>frequency</em> (cycles per seconds or Hertz).  It is the rate of the vibration that produced
                        the sound wave.

                    <p class="fragment">
                        The velocity is a function of the material the wave is travelling through and is roughly
                        constant.  It is determined by things like the ambient air temperature and pressure or the
                        density of a rock.

                        The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.

                    <h2>Frequency vs. Pitch</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Frequency is the measure of how many sound waves occur per second, while pitch is the human
                        perception of how high or low that sound is.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        The keys on the low end (left hand side) of a piano have lower pitch than the keys on the high
                        end (right hand side).
