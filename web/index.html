                    <p class="fragment">
                        Sound is the movement of pressure changes in a material like air or metal.

                    <h2>What is Pressure?</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        Pressure is how "hard" air is pressing against a surface.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        We feel the pressure of the air around us on our bodies.  It feels normal but if we go to higher
                        altitude, we can feel the pressure decrease in our ears.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        When air is "squeezed" into a smaller volume, the pressure gets higher.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        For example, the air pressure inside a balloon is greater than the air pressure outside the
                        balloon.

                        Repetitive back and forth movement.

                    <p class="fragment">
                        Can be a pendulum, a tuning fork, a spring, a guitar string, etc.

                        Also known as oscillation.

                    When a object vibrates, it causes similar vibrations in the pressure of the surrounding air.  These
                    vibrations are detected by the human ear and processed by the brain as sound.
                    <p class="fragment">
                        This is called a sound wave.

                    The distance between the high pressure areas of the sound wave is called the wavelength.
